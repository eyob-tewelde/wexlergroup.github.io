The Wexler Group focuses on theoretical materials innovation for renewable energy and environmental applications. We
develop advanced computational methods to model interfacial phenomena in electrocatalysis, solar energy conversion, and
environmental energy harvesting. Using first-principles calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning, we
aim to understand complex materials systems, discover structure-function relationships, identify promising materials,
and optimize them for enhanced performance.
