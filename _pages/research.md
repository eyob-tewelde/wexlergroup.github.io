# Wexler Group Research

As the damages associated with climate change intensify in the coming years, it will become increasingly important for
educators and researchers to focus on sustainable energy and environmental remediation. Computational materials
chemistry has the potential to revolutionize the industries responsible for these damages by alleviating their reliance
on fossil fuels, precious metals, and toxic elements. Inspired by this potential, the Wexler group's research centers
around solving grand challenges in energy and environment by designing and developing next-generation technologies for
water splitting, CO<sub>2</sub> utilization, solar energy conversion, and environmental energy harvesting. More
specifically, we aim, through theoretical innovations and experimental collaborations, to answer questions like
{: .text-justify}

* "Can we design materials for hydrogen production that are active and stable in extreme environments?"
* "How do precursors influence crystal structure and composition during the synthesis of nanocrystals?"
* "Which properties govern the performance of ferroelectric energy harvesters for the Internet of Things?"
* "How can we overcome selectivity-conversion limits for the electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction?"
* "What factors limit solar-cell efficiency, and how can we control them?"

Answering these questions in catalysis, solar power, and transduction will require improvements in the way that
materials interfaces are currently modeled, which can be achieved via next-generation computational methods for
statistical thermodynamics that combine my expertise in first-principles quantum mechanics calculations, Monte Carlo
simulations, data science, and machine learning. More broadly, the Wexler group's research can be subdivided into four
distinct visions that address these challenges from different angles:
{: .text-justify}

1. To develop state-of-the-art computational techniques for the realistic modeling of materials interfaces
2. To provide fundamental understanding and design principles for sustainable H<sub>2</sub> production and controllable
   CO<sub>2</sub> conversion
3. To create efficient interatomic potentials for the accurate simulation and rational design of ferroelectric energy
   harvesters
4. To improve solar-cell efficiency via chemical modification and interfacial engineering
